Bivariate analysis will be used to study relationships between two variables, such as popularity and ratings or content type and score. Multivariate analysis will further help in understanding how multiple factors interact with each other. Charts like bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, line charts, and heatmaps will be used for better interpretation.\n",

Popularity and votes help measure audience interest but do not always reflect quality. The analysis also highlights growth in content over time and regional dominance specially in country like US which holds 50% of overally releases all over the world. Overall, these insights help in making better content and business decisions."
